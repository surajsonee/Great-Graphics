-   #### Frequent User Goals


### Test Driven Development (TDD)

-   Please see TDD reference in commit messages

-   TDD1: - 
Code does not sort with graphicsTDD = graphics.order_by(sortkey) in graphics/views.py, each sort pulldown gives the same sort output on screen.
Code works correctly with graphics = graphics.order_by(sortkey).
Graphic sorting tested for each menu item both asc and desc.

-   TDD2: - 
add path('bag/', include('bag.urls')), to great_graphics/urls.py
add href="{% url 'view_bag' %}"> to HTML files
add path('', views.view_bag, name='view_bag') to bag/urls.py
add return render(request, 'bag/bag.html') to bag/views.py
python does not run when code in bag/urls.py is changed to path('', views.view_bagTDD, name='view_bag')
browser shows https://8000-violet-fox-0sxtge1d.ws-eu18.gitpod.io/bag/ when bag button is hit wit correct code.



### Further Testing

-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   Social media Icons to be added.
-   Testimonial pages need to be styled.
-   Edit testimonial must only work for the author of the testimonial and the superuser.
-   Can email be modified to originate from great.graphics.com insetad of example .com.
-   tests.py to be updated with tests for each app.

### Flake8

tests.py linter errors not fixed as tests must be added.
in certain circumstances warnings with lines to long were not modified due to the risk of breaking the functionality of the code.
-   linter results - [View](/validation/linter.pdf)

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.

### Acknowledgements

-   My Mentor Guido Cecilio for continuous helpful feedback.
-   Tutor support at Code Institute for their support.
-   Tutor support. db.sqlite3 was corrupted when a model was updated with data in the database. The major part of the database with graphics and categories were downloaded as a JSON file before the database was recreated.

### Bug Fixes

-   Small Bug. checkout.models had a problem with mismatching variables.

checkout/models.py

        self.order_total = self.lineitems.aggregate(Sum('lineitem_total'))['lineitem_total__sum'] or 0
        if self.order_total > settings.DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD:
            self.discount_amount = self.order_total * Decimal(settings.DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE / 100)
        else:
            self.discount_amount = 0


 set self.discount_amount = 0 then did not work for discount so used Decimal there.

-   It was a challenge to get access to tutor support. I received Mentor support in debugging add_testimonial.html
