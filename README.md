-   #### Frequent User Goals


### Test Driven Development (TDD)

-   Please see TDD reference in commit messages

-   TDD1: - 
Code does not sort with graphicsTDD = graphics.order_by(sortkey) in graphics/views.py, each sort pulldown gives the same sort output on screen.
Code works correctly with graphics = graphics.order_by(sortkey).
Graphic sorting tested for each menu item both asc and desc.

-   TDD2: - 
add path('bag/', include('bag.urls')), to great_graphics/urls.py
add href="{% url 'view_bag' %}"> to HTML files
add path('', views.view_bag, name='view_bag') to bag/urls.py
add return render(request, 'bag/bag.html') to bag/views.py
python does not run when code in bag/urls.py is changed to path('', views.view_bagTDD, name='view_bag')
browser shows https://8000-violet-fox-0sxtge1d.ws-eu18.gitpod.io/bag/ when bag button is hit wit correct code.



### Further Testing
